    <h1>International Internship</h1>
    <h2>UCLan - Preston, England</h2>
    <v-subheader>Here I will tell you a bit about meaningful days in my international internship.</v-subheader>

    <h3>Day 0 - 28 Feb 2020</h3>
    <p>
      We woke up very early in the morning to catch our 7am flight from Charleroi to Manchester.
      After an hour and a half flight we arrived in Manchester,
      where we took the train to Preston which was also about an hour and a half ride.
      After getting our keys to the UCLan flat and settling in, we went to say hi to our internship mentor Onno.
      After getting some necessities we went to bed early to rest up for our first day of work on monday.
    </p>

    <h3>First workday - 2 March 2020</h3>
    <p>
      We went to work at around 10am to formally introduce ourselves and get settled in the office.
      We got a tour from Onno since the university has a lot of buildings so we didn't lose our way.
      We still needed some stuff like screens and keyboards, which we 'stole' from another UCLan building.
      After the tour we were introduced to our first assignment which would help us get used to the workflow.

    <h3>Titus' birthday - 5 March 2020</h3>
    <p>
      On the day itself we didn't celebrate too much since we had work to do, but we made up for it in the weekend.
      Celebrated it by playing cards in our flat and drinking alcohol in some cozy pubs.
    </p>
    <h3>Meeting with the big boss - 12 Mar 2020</h3>
    <p>
        We had a meeting with Peter Leather, head of our department, about the big project we were brought in to do.
        Details are confidential but we talked with him to get an idea of what he had in mind. 
        This is where we were trained a bit on how to communicate with a client.
        The conversation was interesting since Onno had already talked with him about it and some things had changed.

    </p>
    <h3>My birthday - 14 Mar 2020</h3>
    <p>
      Since I was lucky enough to have my birthday in the weekend, we could celebrate it on the day itself.
      Went to some pubs and one of the big clubs in Preston.
    </p>
    <h3>Disaster - 16 Mar 2020</h3>
    <p>
      Disaster might be an overstatement, but it felt like it. Coronavirus situation in Belgium was getting pretty severe.
      We weren't sure wether we would still be able to come back and how things would evolve. After a discussion with our parents and Onno,
      we decided it would be best if we went back to Belgium, to be with our family in these unsure times.
    </p>
    <h3>Trip back home - 18 Mar 2020</h3>
    <p>
        This time we were lucky with an evening flight, we had plenty of time to get ready.
        Packed our bags, cleaned our rooms, said our goodbyes and went back to Manchester by train to get on our flight back to Charleroi.
        It was a bit of a sad moment with a lot of uncertainty, but we felt like this was the best we could do.
    </p>
    <h3>Work from home - 23 Mar 2020</h3>
    <p>
        Our first day working from home, we had a lengthy Zoom meeting with Onno, discussing about how we'll work from this point on and discussing 
        about the project and how we'd tackle it.
